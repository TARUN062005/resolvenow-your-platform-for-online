PROJECT REPORT
Guided Project: ResolveNow – Your Platform for Online Complaints
Project Overview
ResolveNow is a comprehensive full-stack web application designed to streamline and digitize the process of complaint registration and resolution. The platform leverages React.js for the frontend, Node.js with Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB as the database to manage persistent data. It serves three types of users: Ordinary Users, Agents, and Admins.

The platform allows users to register complaints, track their progress, and communicate with handling agents. Admins are provided with tools to monitor user activity and assign agents to specific complaints, while agents can interact with assigned complaints and mark them as completed. This creates an efficient, transparent system for managing service or grievance-related requests in an organization or institution.

Project Enhancements (Student Contribution)
As part of the project development and improvement process, several key enhancements were made to improve the user experience, add essential features, and streamline system functionality. The major contributions are outlined below:

1. Complete UI/UX Redesign
The entire user interface was redesigned for a modern, intuitive, and clean look.

The dashboard for all roles (User, Agent, Admin) was overhauled to make the experience smoother and easier to navigate.

The login and signup pages were refined with responsive and visually appealing components.

2. Structured and Modular Codebase
Frontend and backend code were organized into well-defined modules and folders.

Code was made more maintainable by separating components, APIs, and configuration files logically.

Scoped CSS was used to ensure styling conflicts do not occur across pages or components.

3. Help Desk Integration
Developed separate help and support sections for both ordinary users and administrators.

These sections provide quick access to guidance and common issues related to complaint filing and management.

4. Complaint Assignment Features
Significantly improved the complaint assignment interface in the Admin dashboard.

Admin can now assign complaints to agents more easily using a user-friendly dropdown.

Ensured that once a complaint is assigned, it updates in real-time on the UI and reflects the assigned agent name.

Implemented a verification system to prevent the same complaint from being reassigned accidentally.

5. Dashboard Analytics and Statistics
Added functionality for Admin to view the total number of:

Registered users

Complaints submitted

Complaints completed

Implemented a tracking mechanism that monitors user-level complaint activity:

How many complaints each user has submitted

The resolution status of each complaint

6. Agent Assignment and Monitoring System
Introduced a new feature where the assigned agent’s name appears directly under each complaint card for Admins.

Integrated real-time tracking of the status of each assigned complaint:

Whether it is pending, in progress, or completed

The system reflects status changes immediately as agents interact with the complaints.

Implemented a dedicated statistics view to show how many complaints were assigned to each agent.

Admins can now track:

The performance of agents

The workload distribution among agents

The number of complaints resolved versus those still in progress

7. Agent Dashboard Improvements
The Agent dashboard now allows viewing of all complaints assigned specifically to them.

Agents can:

Read complaint details

Access a chat window for each complaint to communicate with users

Mark complaints as completed, which reflects back in the Admin’s analytics and the user’s complaint status

Implemented real-time updates so agents can monitor the current status without needing to refresh manually.

8. Real-time Complaint Status Update
When an agent marks a complaint as completed, the status is immediately updated across the platform.

The user, agent, and admin interfaces reflect this change without delay, ensuring data consistency.

A sync mechanism using local storage was implemented to trigger UI updates where necessary.

Conclusion
These enhancements have transformed ResolveNow from a basic complaint portal into a fully interactive, role-based, data-tracked complaint management system. With the addition of real-time features, structured agent assignment, dynamic dashboards, and scoped styling, the platform is now robust, scalable, and ready for deployment in real-world use cases such as municipal complaint handling, campus feedback systems, or corporate service management. The improvements also focused heavily on usability, modular development, and traceability of actions across all users.
